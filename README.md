# Angular Pet Project

This project is a hands-on learning experience to master JavaScript and the Angular framework. It serves as a personal playground for experimenting with Angular features, exploring best practices, and building a functional application from scratch.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to learn more about new features of angular. This will involve:

*   Setting up an Angular development environment.
*   Creating components, services, and modules.
*   Implementing routing for navigation.
*   Managing application state.
*   Interacting with a mock or real API for data.
*   Writing unit and end-to-end tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
*   [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BeMrTeal/angular-pet-project.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd angular-pet-project
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
